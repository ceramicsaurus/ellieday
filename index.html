            <p class="bdaytext">happy birthday! thank you so so much forever for being the best sister anyone could ask for <3 you also happen to be the best 8-bit/edgar/piper/etc. player i know which is very helpful, especially when i am dying in gem grab. i absolutely cannot wait for us to get better at guitar so that we can start our own band (with the cello) and become gracie abrams. i have your gift, but it is not functional yet & mama said to just finish over the weekend. she's all looks right now (the gift. not our mother), but there's nothing actually going on in the head. unlike us. so. <b>please allow for a small extension.</b>
